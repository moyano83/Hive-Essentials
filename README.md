### Hive overview
Hive is a standard for SQL queries in Hadoop. It provides SQL-like access for data in HDFS. The 
Hive Query Language (HQL) has similar semantics and functions as standard SQL Hiveâ€™s query 
language can run on different computing frameworks, such as MapReduce, Tez, and Spark for better
 performance.
Hive supports a majority of primitive data formats such as _TIMESTAMP_, _STRING_, _FLOAT_, 
_BOOLEAN_, _DECIMAL_, _DOUBLE_, _INT_, _SMALLINT_, _BIGINT_, and complex data types, such as 
_UNION_, _STRUCT_, _MAP_, and _ARRAY_.
Hive Server 2 is available to handle multiple concurrent clients, which support Kerberos, LDAP, 
 and custom pluggable authentication, providing better options for JDBC and ODBC clients, 
  especially for metadata access.
